# Practical Assignment 1 - Neuroscience of Learning, Memory, Cognition

## Overview
This project is part of the **Neuroscience of Learning, Memory, Cognition** course. The goal of this assignment is to introduce students to **Local Field Potential (LFP)** signals, which are critical for understanding brain activity at a local neuronal level. LFPs provide insights into the behavior of small populations of neurons, particularly in relation to their extracellular voltage changes. 

The assignment involves answering conceptual questions related to the LFP signal and its recording methods, and performing some basic signal analysis tasks.

## Local Field Potential (LFP)
### What is LFP?
LFP signals represent the cumulative electrical activity generated by neurons in a small local region of brain tissue. LFP recordings are obtained using **invasive electrodes** placed in the extracellular space near groups of neurons. LFP signals reflect the summation of post-synaptic potentials rather than the individual action potentials of neurons.

### Why study LFP?
LFP signals are crucial for understanding how different parts of the brain process information at a local level. This technique provides insight into the rhythmic and oscillatory nature of neural activity, which is fundamental for understanding various cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and sensory processing.

## Key Concepts
- **Neuron Spikes**: Neurons communicate via action potentials (spikes). The LFP signal captures the aggregate voltage change caused by nearby neurons spiking, giving a sense of the population-level activity.
- **Invasive vs Non-Invasive Recording**: LFP is an invasive technique, requiring electrodes to be implanted within brain tissue. In contrast, non-invasive techniques like EEG record signals from outside the skull, providing a more generalized view of brain activity.

## Assignment Tasks
This notebook contains both theoretical questions and practical tasks to help understand LFP signals:

### 1. Theoretical Questions
You will answer questions related to:
- **What LFP signals represent** and how they are recorded.
- **Neuron spike activity** and how it contributes to the overall LFP signal.
- **Comparison of invasive and non-invasive brain recording methods**, and why LFP is categorized as invasive.

### 2. Signal Processing
- **Signal Representation**: Basic introduction to how LFP signals are represented in terms of voltage changes over time.
- **Preliminary Signal Analysis**: Simple signal visualization and theoretical interpretation of LFP behavior.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:
- Gain a foundational understanding of LFP signals and their significance in neuroscience.
- Understand the difference between invasive and non-invasive brain recording techniques.
- Develop the ability to perform basic analysis of LFP signals.

## Requirements
To run the notebook and reproduce the results, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizing signals.
